# Phishing Website Detection Using URL-Based Features

# What the Project Does
This project uses machine learning to classify websites as phishing and non-phishing. It leverages a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project uses models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines to analyze URL-based, domain, and webpage features. The results provide insights into indicators of phishing and demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in combating cybersecurity threats. 

# Why the Project is Useful

Phishing attacks are a growing concern in cybersecurity, targeting individuals and organizations to steal sensitive information like passwords and financial data. This project:
- Identifies key features that differentiate phishing from legitimate websites.
- Demonstrates lightweight and real-time approaches for detecting phishing sites.
- Provides a foundation for further development of robust and adaptive phishing detection systems
